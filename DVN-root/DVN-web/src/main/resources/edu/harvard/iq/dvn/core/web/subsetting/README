_How to Replicate Analysis_ 


1. If you do not already have R (version 2.7 or later) installed on your 
   computer, install it from:
   
       http://cran.r-project.org

   Note: Some analyses require additional modules, the replication file will
   attempt to install any that are missing, as long as your system is 
   connected to the Internet.  
   
   Note: Because some graphics are generated by dev2bitmap() [Graphics Device
   for Bitmap Files via GhostScript], your computer may need ghostscript
   (see the "Details" section of "dev2bitmap" in the R Reference manual). 


2. Open the accompanying 'zipFile.xxxxxx.xxxxxx.zip' file, and copy the files
   in it to a new location (for example, your desktop).

   Note: This normally contains four files:

    1. citation file            citationFile.xxxxxx.ccccc.txt
    2. RData file               dvnDataFramefile.xxxxxx.aaaaa.tab
    3. R-command file           RcommandFile.xxxxxx.ddddd.R
    4. R-function file          dvn_helper.R

    where xxxxxx and other five-character-long strings are an arbitrary 
    identification numbers.


3. Run R


4. From the R menus, change the working directory to the location of the
   replication files (for example, your desktop)

    Note: In windows, from R, use  File -> "Change dir ..."; 
          in Mac OS X, use Misc => "Change Working Directory ..." 


5. Run the R-command file
    
    From R, use File->"Source File", and select the Rcommandfile.xxxxxx.ddddd.R


6. View results -- these will open automatically in your browser.
